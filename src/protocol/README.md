# Sisyphus Protocol
Sisyphus firmware has its own protocol to communicate with the web interface.

***All of the scripts contained in this directory have 3rd party dependencies, you have been warned.***

This protocol doesn't have to be used only with the interface, this directory includes a [reference Python implementation](protocol.py) of the protocol that you are free to use for your own endeavors.
It also includes [full documentation](PROTOCOL.md) of the protocol that should be enough for you to write your own client. If it's not enough yell at me in the issues.

If you just want to access the device, you can also use a [handy shell](shell.py).

You can also use the [audio conversion script](convert.py) for loading your audio on your device.

There is also a [script](color_graph.py) originally meant for debugging the color sensor.
